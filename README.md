# Online Visualizer

## How to

Should work on Chrome, feel free to raise issues on other browser, but not sure I'll correct them.

Url to access:  
http://pogo.nicontoso.eu/

Tips, you can add the url to connect to directly (if you have multiple bots):  
http://pogo.nicontoso.eu//?websocket=ws://localhost:14252

The port to put it here is port port you define in Necrobot config + 1 (14251 by default gives 14252 here).
